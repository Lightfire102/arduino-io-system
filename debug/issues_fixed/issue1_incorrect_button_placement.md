# Issue: Button misplacement

I mistakenly placed the buttons in the board incorrectly because I was not aware of what the proper way of inserting the button into the breadboard. However, using my multimeter, i was able to check the button by selecting the wifi looking setting on the multimeter and press down on the button while holding the probes to see the correct placement of the buttons. Idk how else to explain that but I have a picture and video of me doing so!
