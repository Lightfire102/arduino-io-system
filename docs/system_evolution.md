# System Evolution

This repo shows the progression of working with Arduino I/O rather than separate one-off tutorials.

## Phase 1 – LED Output (Blink)
- Started with blinking the onboard LED and an external LED
- Learned basic GPIO setup and timing
- Verified behavior visually

## Phase 2 – Inputs + Serial Debug
- Added buttons as inputs
- Used the serial monitor (PuTTY) to print button presses
- Learned how helpful serial output is for debugging hardware issues

## Phase 3 – Simon Game Build
- Expanded the system to multiple buttons, LEDs, and a buzzer
- Each input maps to a color, LED, and tone
- System reacts in real time to user interaction

Instead of treating these as separate projects, I treated them as one growing system that became more complex over time.
