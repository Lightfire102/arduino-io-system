# arduino-io-system
This project shows the evolution of a basic Arduino GPIO output (blinking a single LED) into a fully functional input/output system using multiple LEDs and buttons, ending with a partial Simon memory game. The point of this was for learning system growth, modular firmware structures and debugging using serial output.
